    <h3>What is PennApps Health?</h3>
    <div class="block_1"></div> <hr />
    <p>PennApps is the premier student hackathon. 1200 student engineers descend on the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for a 40-hour competition to see who can build the best web, mobile, and hardware tools. These talented hackers are chosen from more than 2000 applicants across the globe, representing over 100 elite universities and medical schools.
    </p>

    <h5>&#34Of all the hackathons I&#39ve ever been to, and that&#39s somewhere well into the 100s by now, PennApps stands out as one of the most impressive by far. Spending 48 hours with the best and brightest students the world has to offer and seeing the amazing things they 
produce is an awe inspiring and humbling experience. I haven&#39t missed a PennApps in 
over 3 years. I won&#39t miss this one, and neither should you.&#34 
    </h5>
    
    <h6> - Mike Swift, Major League Hacking Director</h6>

    <p>For the first time, PennApps engineers will be hacking on health and medical problems. We have partnered with Penn Medicine to help medical students and professionals code themselves and learn the languages of information technology. Staff from the Perelman School of Medicine, Penn Center for Innovation, and University of Pennsylvania Health System will be involved as mentors and hackers. Just before the event starts, we will host a health and medicine fair where hackers can meet each other and our mentors, as well as learn about the data and hardware available. </p>

    <p>We will provide datasets/APIs, hardware, and lab access to any health hackers. Over the summer we are running a coding tutorial to prepare medical students for the September hackathon. This tutorial covers the coding basics required to build a web app. Our tutorial will run again as a week long crash course, just prior to the beginning of PennApps X on September 12. </p>

    <p>We need sponsors&#39 help in providing even more useful data, hardware, and mentors

    <h3>Why sponsor?</h3>
    <div class="block_1"></div> <hr />
    <p>PennApps is the best place to recruit top tech talent. Participants come from top CS schools from around the world such as Stanford, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, ETH Zurich and National University of Singapore. Our hackathon always receives considerable press, and past PennApps hacks have gone on to YCombinator, launch as successful startups, and join fantastic companies.
    </p>

    <p>Although students are free to create their own hacks, sponsors are encouraged to influence projects through branded prizes, API demos, tech talks, and swag. Sponsors can easily find engineers interested in their product and vision. 
    </p>


    <h3>How to be a successful Sponsor?</h3>
    <div class="block_1"></div> <hr />
    
    <p> <b>1. Bring company engineers and mentors.</b> Being a mentor at PennApps is a great way to interact with the participants, provide help with company APIs or other technologies, and further establish company rapport and brand recognition. 
    </p>  

    <p><b>2. Sponsor fun events.</b> We&#39ve had ice skating, chess tournaments, arcade games, Nerf Gun fights, photo booths and more. 
    </p>

    <p><b>3. Send company swag.</b> Participants love t-shirts, hats, laptop stickers, water bottles, cards, pens, frisbees, bags, etc. These items are an easy way to build company brand recognition and general positive spirit.
